This project also has the capability of creating a mini web server and complete machining user interface by way of free-license software CNCJS, which allows the user to access the CNC router remotely within the network.

      "projectDesc": "The purpose of this project was to assist individuals in setting up a home network monitoring system. The primary core, was to implement Nagios (network monitoring software), using a Raspberry Pi 4, to enable home network monitoring services with NEMS. My secondary goal was to setup a VPN server. This would allow users to access their home network from anywhere. An extension of this system is the addition of an ad-blocking agent, such as Pi-Hole. This would allow users to block ads over their entire network and even outside of their network, via connecting through the above-mentioned VPN server. This is a major benefit because not only is there no need to install apps or extensions on every device connected to the network, but additionally this service can be accessed outside of their home network.",

This project aims to setup and provide an example of network-based adblocking via the usage of hardware devices running a DNS sinkhole. Currently, my project has been successful in both Core 1 and Core 2 objectives. Core 1 (with adjustments) provided proof-of-concept while Core 2 proved the concept successful with usage of a Raspberry Pi device.
