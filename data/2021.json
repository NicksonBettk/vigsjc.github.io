      "projectDesc": "Over the past decade, there has been a rise in hobbyists creating their own arcade emulators. The reasons for this include the fragility and prohibitive price of classic consoles and games, advances in emulation technology and programming, the relative affordability of doing it yourself, and the appeal of complete customization. This particular project is a classic arcade game emulator powered by a Raspberry Pi, which is portable in nature and includes a two player setup with eight buttons and a joystick for each participant. Given their popularity, there are already commercial versions of this type available. However, it is still more affordable to make it yourself and it gives the designer much more freedom in customization of the unit and the number or types of playable games. Commercial versions usually limit games available by brand or time period. Currently, I have successfully completed both core phases of my project with the majority of adjustments being made in Core 1 to accommodate challenges in design and materials. The extension phase, which is primarily cosmetics, is dependent on remaining time constraints",

Among the many different types of imaging software, the one I chose for this project is called FOG, this software has a very user friendly GUI that allows you to capture an image through PXE and then be able to upload that image on to multiple computers at a time.",

This is achieved through a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with Debian-based Raspberry Pi OS installed on the system. The device in use “…has evolved from a tool for students and hobbyists to a viable option for certain types of engineering projects in the form of the Compute Module, and most recently the Raspberry Pi Pico” (Hutchinson, 2021). The device is then connected to a breadboard via GPIO interface with instructions provided by the Python coding language. The Freenove Ultimate Starter Kit will provide all the various connectors and diodes required for the project. The primary motivation regarding this project consider networking connectivity issues. Network connections, especially for personal use, tend to fail on occasion. Knowing when those networks go down and applying the information may help resolve the problem",

By having someone come feed their cat, it could lead to potential issues, for example stolen property and doors being left unlocked. My parents would greatly benefit for a product like this, so they do not have to worry when they are not home.\nThis project will allow for an automated way to feed the cat both on demand and on a schedule with the use of a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi runs a python code that is responsible for monitoring a Gmail account. When an email arrives with the expected subject “feed cats”, the cat feeder will dispense food. The use of a Raspberry Pi camera module will also be involved in allowing you to check in on your cat enjoying the food.",

      "projectDesc": "Home security systems are becoming more common as technology in our society advances. The want and need to be able to keep an eye on your home and your belongings is at an all time high. The only issue is these security systems can be very expensive. This is where the Raspberry Pi can come into play. For a relatively cheap price, anyone can take a Raspberry Pi and turn it into their very own home security system. This is what I set out to do with my project. As of now, I have been successful in creating a working home security camera. My core phase 1 was to get the Raspberry Pi 4 up and running, and download and install the MotionEyeOS onto the board. My core phase 2 was to build a custom case for the Pi so that it could be concealed. My extension phase was to configure the camera module to have motion detection, and to send an email with the video taken every time the camera took a video. I have been successful in completing all three of my phases.",

With the use of the microcontroller the system can be used autonomously. It will have the capability to detect motion, color, and general shape. The foundation of this project is based on a Pixy camera with a built-in processor and image sensor paired with an Arduino microcontroller to run the vision software. The addition of a pan and tilt servomotor allows the camera system to orientate on motion and retain central focus of it. The Pixy2 camera module operates on software called PixyMon, which allows specific configurations to visual signatures. The Arduino Uno can be programmed to load and run code libraries on the Arduino IDE software.",

However, being able to play older games in todays world can be a bit challenging. Due to Covid-19, arcades had struggled to stay in business by helping prevent the spread of the virus. Whether it is an original arcade game or one of the first home consoles, being able to start your own collection can take a lot of time, money, and space not to mention that it is difficult to find and play on original hardware.\nA solution to this problem is by building my own miniature arcade cabinet. By using a Raspberry Pi 3b+ and by downloading emulation software, I can play a variety of different games from multiple consoles. These games are either open sourced, meaning that it is free code that the developer of the game has given permission to download, or it is a game rom of a game that I currently own in my collection. After purchasing an arcade kit online and by finding the remaining parts as well, I was able to build a mini arcade machine that I can place on any surface and use traditional arcade controls to play these older games. \n",

Having a safe household is comforting and needed as people spend most of their time at home with their families and loved ones. Being able to provide the safety for a cheaper price, and same reliability, makes things easier for everyone involved. I am proposing a cheaper version of the home security system with the same reliability as some companies out on the market already. Using the Raspberry Pi, a more compact and cheaper system, with the camera module and PIR sensor I am able to secure a home with notifications of any motion detected.",
